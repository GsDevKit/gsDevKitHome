# Open Source Development Kit for GemStone/S 64 Bit

This Development Kit for GemStone/S provides a framework for managing multiple GemStone stone instances across multiple machines.

The Development Kit provides a [set of scripts][5] for:
* Downloading [GemStone/S][6] and [Pharo][7].
* Building and maintaining the [tODE][8] development image.
* Creating new stone instances.
* Starting and stopping stones.

The [gemstone directory][9] has predefined locations for:
* [Download files][10].
* [GemStone/S product versions][11].
* [Stone instances][12].

The [pharo directory][14] contains an installation of Pharo3.0 that is used for the tODE client as well as for implementing a number of the Development Kit scripts. 

The [tode directory][13] provides an collection of tode scripts that are intended to be shared between your development and production servers. 

The Development Kit is intended to be [forked][1] and [cloned][4].
The fork serves two purposes:
   * The fork makes it very easy to contribute bugfixes and enhancements to the parent project.
   * The fork makes it easy for you to share your project specific artifacts (primarily tODE scripts) between your development and production servers.

##Development Kit Server Installation

The GemStone server may be installed on Linux or Mac. 

1. [Fork][3] the [gsDevKitHome project][2] on [GitHub][15].
2. Clone your fork of the [gsDevKitHome project][2] to your GemStone development server and create a unique branch for your project-specific changes.
   Changes that you want to share with the community should be made on the master branch:

   ```Shell
   git clone git@github.com:<your github id>/gsDevKitHome.git
   cd gsDevKitHome
   git checkout -b  <your branch name>
   ```

3. Define the `$GS_HOME` environment variable and add `$GS_HOME/bin` to your `$PATH`:

   ```Shell
   cd gsDevKitHome
   export GS_HOME=`pwd`
   export PATH=$GS_HOME/bin:$PATH
   ```

   It's a good idea to define `$GS_HOME` and `$PATH` in your `.bashrc` file.
4. Install GemStone/S and Pharo, build the tODE client image, create a stone, start the stone, start the netldi, start the stamonitors, install tODE in stone and launch the tODE client. 
   The following creates a new stone named `tode` based on [version 3.2.1 of GemStone/S][16]:

   ```Shell
   installServer tode 3.2.1
   ```

   *Note that the script will prompt you for your password because it uses sudo to setup up your server for running GemStone*.
  

4.  When the above script finishes, the tode client image is opened and you should be able to validate your session description by:

   1. First, opening a tODE shell on your stone: 
   
      ![open tode shell][18]

   2. Then, opening a `project list`:

      ![project list][19]

   3. If the `project list` opens successfully, then you are done.
      If an error occurs, use the testLogin command to gather diagnostic information:

      ![testLogin output][20]

5. Once you have verified that the session description is correct, you should commit the changes that you've made and push them to GitHub:

   ```Shell
   git status                          # see what changes have been made
   git add --all                       # stage the changed files
   git commit -m"initial installation" # commit changes
   git push origin <your branch name>  # push the changes to GitHub
   ```

6. If you have a separate client machine separate from your development server, then follow the [tODE client installation instructions][17].

7. **Have Fun working with GemStone and tODE!**
