# *Reverse* Pull Request
The [Using pull requests][1] article on GitHub gives a very good description of using a pull request to share code from your fork with a master repository.

A *reverse pull request* is where you use a pull request to **update your fork from a master**.

In my example I'm going to update *dalehenrich/gsDevKitHome* from *GsDevKit/gsDevKitHome*:

1. The basic trick is to **initiate the pull request from the master repository:**

   ---
   ---
   
      ![step 1][2]
   
   ---
   ---

2. Press that funky green button ![step 1.5][8] in the main screen to bring up the *compare screen*:

   ---
   ---
   
      ![step 2][3]
   
   --- 
   ---

3. Click on the *compare across forks* link ![step 2.5][9] in the *compare screen* to bring up the *branch selection screen* :

   ---
   ---
   ![step 3][4]
   
   ---
   ---

4. Using the **base fork:** drop down, select your fork:

   ---
   ---
   
   ![step 4][5]
   
   ---
   ---

5. Press the **Create pull request** button:

   ---
   ---
   
   ![step 5][6]
   
   ---
   ---

From here you can follow the steps for [Sending the pull request][7] from the [Using pull requests][1] article.
